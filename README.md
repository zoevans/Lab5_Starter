1) No I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because the feature is not an isolated component that I can test since it has both writing and messaging aspects, and unit tests are only for testing isolated components of code.

2) Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application because the feature only tests a singular component of the code and does not deal with multiple different aspects of the code, making it perfect for unit testing because unit tests are meant to test isolated components of code.
